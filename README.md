# YouToolBox!
YouToolBox is a Youtube utility userscript!
It features three main functions,
## Quick Settings
I hate the fact that I need to click 4-5 times just to do something simple like change the quaity of a video, or its playback speed. YouToolBox addresses this by providing a quck settings menu to change these settings.
## Note Taking
While watching an academic video, sometimes, something clicks which I need to note down. Sadly, the best I found to do this was to have another window or tab with some application like notepad. However, now, jotting down of important details may be done easier.
## Calculator
Say you are watching a video. You see your favourite youtuber have incredibly bad luck. 'What's the chance he gets this unlucky', you think to yourself That's where this tool comes in handy. this integrates a calculator in youtube so my laziness doesn't get the best of me.
